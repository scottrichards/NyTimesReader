## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was surprised at how easy it was to add the rounded image library (although you get this functionality built into iOS). Also sepcifying a loading image was really straighforward with Picasso.

## Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) - Image loading and caching library for Android
